# Excel
I am Practicing Excel Exercises
The Excel Exercises I've started practicing are from a Business Intelligence analyst course from Udemy. As I want to make a career in Business Analytics I Started learning Excel, Power BI, and SQL

I have created branches and uploaded my work as screenshots please check there! 

Note: I am starting my career in business analytics if there's any mistake in my work please suggest me I'm open to learn
