In the below example, the hypothesis testing is done by standadizing the variable anad comparing it to the Z
We Standardize a variable by subtracting the mean & dividing by the standard deviation
The closer the difference between X-bar and Mu0 to Zero, the closer the Z-Score itself to Zero, This Imlplies a higher chance to accept the null Hypothesis.
if the Z-score is higher than 1.96 we reject the NULL HYPOTHESIS and ViceVersa
