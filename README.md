The below image shows the Standard Normal Distribution exercise it is also known as Z-Distribution
if we compare two datasets(which is original dataset and the new dataset) the mean and Standard Deviation are different but the plotted graph has no difference the value here tells us that the data dispersion is more in the original dataset which means data points lie in various plots but in the new dataset the standard deviation which is 1 shows concentrated data points in one place this makes useful to predict and make inferences much easier

below Confidence Interval exercise has been done by me which is to find an estimate point between the Interval of given dataset we will do by finding standard error,ReliabilityFactor and Point Estimate
